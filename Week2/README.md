# Week 2 Challenges

## Challenge 1
### From the Smart Contracts Weekness Clasification list, choose 2 vulnerabilities that you might consider interesting and explain the proposed solution(s).

* TBD

## Challenge 2
### Implement a smart contract that uses OpenZeppelin's contracts library. It must use some of the contracts that implement ERC standard and another one of your preference from the library. Describe why you chose those contracts

* [X] Contract
  * PlatziToken
    * ERC777
    * Ownable
* [X] Tests
* [X] Choice justification
  * I wanted to implement an improve version of the ERC20 (ERC777) that provides better and more reliable ways to transfer tokens between contracts
  * Also I needed to implement a way to mint new tokens securing who can mint them (owner)
